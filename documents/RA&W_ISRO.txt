1. Early Collaboration & National Priorities
- In the mid-1960s, India’s space program was in its infancy under Vikram Sarabhai.
- RAW, formed in 1968, was tasked not only with external intelligence but also with safeguarding India’s emerging nuclear and space programs, especially as they became strategic.
- ISRO’s scientists were heavily dependent on foreign collaborations (NASA, USSR, later France). RAW helped ensure these exchanges didn’t compromise national security.

2. Protecting Scientists & Research
- During the Cold War, Indian scientists were under watch by both the CIA and KGB. There were concerns about espionage, sabotage, and even threats to individual scientists.
- RAW reportedly maintained surveillance and protective measures around ISRO leadership and facilities (e.g., Thumba, Sriharikota).
- This included counter-intelligence operations to detect foreign attempts at infiltrating ISRO’s projects.

3. Technology Denials & Sanctions
- After India’s nuclear tests (1974, 1998), the US and Western nations imposed technology denial regimes (MTCR, sanctions).
- RAW worked to create backchannels, monitor global suppliers, and sometimes facilitate covert acquisition of critical technologies for ISRO when formal channels were blocked.
- This shielded ISRO’s growth in rocket and satellite technology, especially the PSLV program.

4. Rocket Development & Security
- The 1970s–80s saw India building SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) and later PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle).
- RAW coordinated with ISRO and defense agencies to protect blueprints, test sites, and transport of rocket components.
- When foreign agencies tried to block cryogenic engine technology transfer from Russia in the 1990s, RAW tracked negotiations, pressure tactics, and ensured ISRO kept its indigenous development path secure.

5. Assassination & Espionage Concerns
- Multiple ISRO scientists over the decades faced mysterious deaths, accidents, or espionage accusations (e.g., the Nambi Narayanan spy case in 1994, which was later proven false).
- RAW was often pulled in to investigate, though sometimes political motives clouded these cases.
- Broadly, RAW’s role was to pre-empt sabotage and shield ISRO’s human capital from foreign intelligence services.

6. Strategic Outcome
- Thanks to this quiet collaboration, India’s space program grew steadily despite embargoes and espionage threats.
- ISRO developed indigenous satellite launch capability, remote sensing, and planetary missions (Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan).
- RAW ensured that India’s scientists and rocket programs survived external pressure long enough to become self-reliant.

In short: ISRO built, RAW protected. ISRO provided the scientific vision and engineering genius, while RAW shielded the organization from foreign sabotage, espionage, and technology denials—helping India become one of the few nations with independent rocket and satellite launch capability.
