Battle of Ten Kings (Rigveda – Daśarājña)

Summary
The “Battle of Ten Kings” (Daśarājña) is described in the Rigveda (mainly 7.18, with related hymns in 7.33 and 7.83). It tells of King Sudās of the Bharata tribe defeating a coalition of roughly ten tribes on the banks of the Paruṣṇī (often identified with the Ravi) during the early Vedic period (likely 2nd millennium BCE). Sudās’ victory is credited partly to his priest Vasiṣṭha and to bold tactics at the river.

Where and who
• River: Paruṣṇī (Ravi), sometimes linked with the wider Sarasvatī region in other hymns.
• Sudās: Bharata king; allied with the priest Vasiṣṭha. 
• Coalition: about ten tribes including Puru, Anu, Druhyu, Turvaśa, Yadu, and others often listed as Alina, Bhalāna, Paktha, Śiva, Viśānin, etc. (lists vary by scholar and hymn interpretation).
• A long-standing rivalry between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra (another famous seer) is occasionally connected to the political alignments around Sudās.

Why it mattered
• Consolidation: The Bharatas’ win let them dominate the upper Indus–Sarasvatī–Ravi area and mingle later with the Purus, which many historians see as a step toward the later Kuru polity.
• Society: Hymns frame the battle as divine favor for correct ritual and leadership.
• Memory: The episode became an early Vedic “origin story” of power shifts among tribes.

Tactics mentioned in hymns (as interpreted by scholars)
• Sudās used the river crossing to his advantage; the coalition was caught in disarray.
• The hymns praise Indra’s help, the chariots, and the protection of the Bharata host.

Uncertainties and debates
• Exact date is unknown; the Rigveda is a layered text compiled over time.
• Tribe lists and identities differ by hymn and translation.
• Geography: Paruṣṇī is usually equated with the Ravi, but details of the battlefield remain debated.

Mini glossary
• Bharata: Vedic tribe of Sudās; later traditions link “Bhārata” to the name of India.
• Vasiṣṭha / Viśvāmitra: Influential Vedic ṛṣis (seers/poets) associated with rival factions.
• Paruṣṇī: River named in the Rigveda; commonly identified with Ravi in Punjab.
